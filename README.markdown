Roadmap

There are a list of opened [issues](issues/) of improvement for the project. The main next steps are:

*	Localization - Currently, we support English and Portuguese. We intend to translate the resources to other languages like Spanish, French, Italian and German. 

The project is open for new ideas for bringing Holy Bible nearer people. Fell free to sugest.

Environment
-----------
This is the current environment we are using to develop:

*	Eclipse IDE 3.6 (Helios)
*	Oracle Java 6 SDK
*	Android SDK r18
*	Android Development Tools (ADT) Plugin for Eclipse.

The app aims the old Android 2.1 platform, so it is compatible with almost any current device (mobile or tablet)

Dependencies
-----------
*	ActionBarSherlock - As native ActionBar is supported only from Android 3.0+, we use ActionBarSherlock API open-source project to mimic that behavior on Android 2.1+ devices. P.s. ActionBarSherlock requires including Android 4.0 library in the project, therefore Heavens Advice continue working on older devices.
